      Welcome to My Website!

Hi there! I'm Pranay Jadhao a Frontend Developer, a growing Full Stack Developer, and a Computer Science student who loves building things with code.

This website is my little corner of the internet where you can see what I've been working on, what I'm learning, and what I'm passionate about.

I enjoy making websites that are not only nice to look at, but also easy to use. On the frontend, I work with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React to bring ideas to life. Behind the scenes, Im learning how to build full web applications using Node.js, Express, and databases like MongoDB and PostgreSQL.

I'm currently studying Computer Science, where I'm learning everything from programming and algorithms to how computers really work. Every project I build helps me grow and become a better developer.

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React

ðŸŒ± Always Learning

Every day, I try to learn something new. Whether it's solving a bug, trying a new framework, or reading about the latest tech trends, I love improving my skills.

Thanks for visiting my website â€” feel free to look around!
